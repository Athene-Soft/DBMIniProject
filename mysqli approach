--mysqli approach--

Please follow these steps, this will help us when are to debug the our codes.

//1.connection
$conn = new mysqli ("myServer","myUser","myPassword","dbName");

//2.write the query
$query="SELECT CompanyName, City, Country FROM Customers"

//3.submit the query
$result= $conn->query($query);

//4.retrieving data from "$result" object to another object (here we use $rs variable, meaning "result set")
//according a desired format (here we retrieve data from $result to $rs as an associative array)
$rs= $result->fetch_array(MYSQLI_ASSOC); //Malmee see online php docs for more infor on fetch_array() method

//5.close the connection
$conn-> close();

NOTE: in steps 1 to 4 please add error checks and if there is any error, as assign the error to a
separate variable for later consideration in the code when needed.

cheers...happy coding :)
